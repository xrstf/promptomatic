# Promptomatic

This is my terminal prompt. Back in the days I had it written in Bash, but it quickly became unmaintainable and I dreaded every new system that I had to re-use it.

Now my prompt is written in Go, which is much easier, faster and maintanable.

You will probably not find this terribly useful, as this repository and its code is extremely opinionated.

All of this is purpose-built for Zsh and Zsh only. If it works on Bash as well, great, but that's just by accident.
